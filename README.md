## üíª Code Explanation

### Core PHP Logic

1. **Bot Token and URLs**:  
   The bot uses the Telegram API to send messages and files. Replace `token_here` with your actual Telegram bot token.

2. **Handling User Input**:
   - The script checks for valid URLs using `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`. 
   - Once a valid link is detected, it sends a request to the external service (e.g., Cobalt API) to retrieve the media.

3. **Downloading Media**:
   - The bot downloads the media using a `curl` request to the external service, then uploads it to Telegram.

4. **Sending Files to Telegram**:
   - After the media is successfully downloaded, the bot uploads it to Telegram using `sendDocument`, along with a caption containing the original link.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If a download or upload fails, the bot informs the user of the failure.
